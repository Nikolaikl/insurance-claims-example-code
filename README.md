# README - Claims Program

The programm is setup with codepaces such that all required make dependencies are installed

Add plugins you like to your dev container in VSCode yourself ðŸ¥‚,

like vim movements, emacs or nyan-cat

## Task Overview

possible tasks include

### Debug Running Programm

we have the following error logs when running `make run`:

```shell
GEOGRAPHIC FACTOR FILE CREATED SUCCESSFULLY
Running bin/indsetup...
BDB0004 fop_read_meta: data/INDFILE: unexpected file type or format
BDB0004 fop_read_meta: data/INDFILE: unexpected file type or format
```

**Investigate:**
- What is causing the `INDFILE` format issue?
- Is the file corrupted or missing?
- Are there dependencies or setup steps missing?


### Enhance Features

- The current output is dumped to `data/OUTPUT.txt`. Consider:
  - Formatting the output for better readability (e.g., JSON, CSV).
  - Adding logging for debugging purposes.
  - Implementing a more dynamic output system (e.g., CLI flags for output format).

### Refactor to Modern Languages

The codebase is unique but outdated. Potential refactoring options:
- **Java/Kotlin**: For better maintainability and modern tooling.
- **Python**: For rapid prototyping and scripting capabilities.
- **API Design**: Expose functionality as a REST or GraphQL API for easier integration.

### Testing and Security

**Testing:**
- Add unit tests for critical functions (e.g., file parsing, calculations).
- Integrate a testing framework (e.g., JUnit for Java, pytest for Python).
- Set up automated testing in the CI/CD pipeline.

**Security:**
- Audit the code for vulnerabilities (e.g., file handling, input validation).
- Implement secure coding practices (e.g., avoid hardcoded paths, sanitize inputs).
- Add static analysis tools (e.g., SonarQube, Bandit for Python).

### CI/CD Pipeline Improvements

- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Add checks for linting, formatting, and basic tests.
- **Automated Builds**: Ensure builds are reproducible and dependencies are pinned.
- **Deployment**: Add staging/production deployment scripts.
- **Monitoring**: Integrate logging and monitoring for runtime issues.

## Building and Running

Use the Makefile for all build tasks:

```bash
# Build all programs (default)
make

# Build setup programs
make setup

# Build main program
make pensclm

# Run full processing pipeline
make run

# Clean built binaries
make clean

# Set up development environment
make setup-env
```

The Makefile handles:

- Automatic dependency tracking
- Output file organization in bin/
- Parallel builds where possible
- Clean rebuilds
